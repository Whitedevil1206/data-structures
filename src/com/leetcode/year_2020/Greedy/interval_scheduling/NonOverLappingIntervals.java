         * This problem is the variation of {@link MergeIntervals}

         * to make the whole intervals non-overlapping.

         * We have to just remove 1 interval which is {1,3}. to make it non-overlapping.
         *
         * 1. We have to sort the intervals based on their Finish Time... reason intervals with
         *    earliest endTime gives us more space to accommodate extra intervals, v/s if we choose the interval
         *    with End Time as largest we will have no space to accommodate more intervals.
         * 2. Here also we will take baseInterval and do the comparision with other intervals. Now in this variation we have to reject
         *    the overlapping interval.
         *    So if(currInterval[startTime] < baseInterval[endTime]) currentInterval has to be rejected....
         *    we will only consider those interval where currInterval[start] > baseInterval.
