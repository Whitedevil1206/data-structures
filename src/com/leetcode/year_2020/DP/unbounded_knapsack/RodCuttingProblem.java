         * This problem is similar to 0/1 Knapsack, where we were given weight[], valueOfArray[], capacity of bag
         * and we have to choose the weights such that it's under capacity and maxProfit.
         *
         * Here also we have given price of each cut of rod.
         * |1|2|3|4|    <====== Cuts of pieceLength
         * |5|6|8|8|    <====== Price of respective cuts.
         * nd Length of Rod is 4.
         * Now the only difference from 0/1 here is that we can choose the same cut multiple times
         *
         * We can cut the rod in pieces of cutLength "1" 4 times, but in 0/1 Knapsack we can't choose the same weight multiple times.
         *
         * Hence this problem is of type unbounded knapsack.
         * So lets solve it.
